The steps for the banker's algorithm are:
Initialize vectors: Initialize the vectors Work and Finish. Work contains the resources of each type, and Finish indicates if a process has finished execution. Set Work to Available and Finish[i] to false. 
Find a process: Find a process where Finish[i] = false and Need[i] <= Work. If such a process exists, continue to step 3. 
Add the process to allocation: Add the process that satisfies Need[i] <= Work to Allocation[i]. 
Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all processes have completed execution. 
Check for a safe state: If Finish[i] = true for all i, then the system is safe.
